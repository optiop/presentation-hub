# CNCF Meetup - Frankfurt am Main

## Proposal 

* **Title**: Metric collection with Prometheus, Thanos, and Mimir
* **Description**:  Observability is built on four key pillars: Profiling, Tracing, Logging, and Metrics. 
In this talk, we will take a deep dive into Metrics. We will discuss the importance of metrics, 
how to collect them, and how to store them. We will also explore three major open-source projects 
in the Cloud Native ecosystem for metric collection: Prometheus, Thanos, and Mimir.
  - **Prometheus** – A powerful monitoring and alerting toolkit, widely adopted in the Cloud Native ecosystem.
  - **Thanos** – A project that extends Prometheus with horizontal scalability and long-term storage.
  - **Mimir** – A high-performance metric storage and querying solution from Grafana Labs, designed to handle Prometheus data more efficiently.
* **Speaker**: Mehrshad Lotfi - DevOps Engineer @ Optiop
* **Bio**: Mehrshad is a DevOps Engineer with a strong focus on enhancing observability platforms. His passion lies in empowering teams with valuable insights and metrics from their applications, helping them make data-driven decisions to improve reliability and performance.
